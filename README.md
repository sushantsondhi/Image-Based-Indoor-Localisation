# Image-Based-Indoor-Localisation

##Overview
It is often seen that blind people have a lot of diﬃculty in ﬁnding their way through unknown buildings. There being no special aid or
instrument, whatsoever, available to them, their only ways of navigating in a new surrounding are their walking stick and constantly asking
passersby for help. This deprives them of their sense of independence and freedom. So the aim of this project is to build a navigation
system to assist the blind people inside an unknown building. The current methods for navigating inside a building mostly rely on the use
of well-placed beacons inside a building and the location of a person is determined by triangulating the signals from these beacons.
Our aim is to make system without adding much /any additional equipment to the infrastructure of the building, thus increasing the
feasibility and minimizing cost. 

##Demonstration
A prototype of the working demonstration can be found here. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_QE4poxZA_qykM25uo0iLsJHQe69xiYO/view?usp=sharing. The video in the bottom right corner of the screen is the live query video sent by the user. The graph in the top left displays the current loction of the user and the video adjacent to graph displays the unique frames being extracted out of video and processed.
